			<h2>Nutrition is Paramount!</h2>
			<div class="eat-healthier-text">
			<p>Eating healthier and doing it consistently is the key. For example â€“ if you eat ice cream every night, your body is going to get bigger. If you eat french fries every day for lunch, your body is not going to respond kindly. However, if you eat a healthy balanced diet daily, you will lose weight and feel energized because you are giving your body what it needs to function at its full potential!</p>
			<p>If you need help with your nutritional transition, Team Beachbody has an excellent tool that can help. It is called the Meal Planning Wizard. It puts together a meal plan tailored just for you. I still use it and it keeps me on track. The program takes all of the guesswork out of what to eat and how much because it does it for you.  It calculates meals with foods you can find in your local grocery store that you will also enjoy eating.</p>
