				<h2>Michele Martin</h2>
				<p>I am an ambitious, energetic gal that loves to volunteer in my community. I am also a dedicated Team Beachbody member and here’s why: it works and I’m living proof that it does.</p>
				<p>I’ve done every program out there short of surgery. One of my closest friends had been doing Beachbody programs for more than two years and would mention it to me on occasion.</p>
				<p>It wasn’t until April 18, 2012, when I woke up with no energy and absolutely no self-confidence that I made a decision that would change my life for the better. I looked into the mirror and said, “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.” I ordered a Challenge Pack, got in a Challenge Group, and started the program full throttle!</p>
				<p>In 30 days, I went from 5’2”, 187 pounds, and on medication for type II diabetes and cholesterol to losing 15 pounds and having my doctor taking me off the medication.</p>
				<p>If I can do it, you can too!</p>
